### Personal Summary

Starting my career as a computer science teacher in 2000 at the public school #495 in St. Petersburg, Russia, I taught the basics of programming languages such as Pascal, Delphi and some web technologies such as the basics of HTML and CSS. After 2 years I changed my line of work to a sales manager of computer components in the largest store of my city.

In 2005 I graduated from the institute with a specialization in “computer-aided design of radio-electronic devices”. In 2012 I changed my specialization from sales to system administration and started to study server software such as mail servers, sip-telephony and others. Also in 2014, I started working on a project that helps medical centers organize their business processes. While working on it, I started learning JS, jQuery, MySQL, and the PHP stack.

Currently, I am working on two different projects in the logistics software field and I need to learn programming tools like Git and in this course I am updating my knowledge to keep up to date.
